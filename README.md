## Overview

This project, "My New Pet," is a mobile application developed using Jetpack Compose and Kotlin. The primary goal is to showcase various key features and best practices in Android app development. The app follows a modern and efficient architecture, utilizing state management, unidirectional data flow, events, and higher-order functions.

## Key Features

### Jetpack Compose

Jetpack Compose is used as the UI toolkit for building native Android applications. It provides a modern and declarative way to create user interfaces, making UI development more intuitive and efficient.

### Kotlin

The entire project is implemented in Kotlin, a powerful and expressive programming language. Kotlin is the preferred language for Android development, offering concise syntax and advanced features that enhance developer productivity.

### State Management

State management is a crucial aspect of any interactive application. This project employs a unidirectional data flow architecture to manage and propagate the application's state seamlessly. This ensures a predictable and maintainable codebase.

### Events and States

The use of events and states in the app enhances the decoupling of components, making the application more modular and scalable. Events represent user interactions or system events, while states capture the current state of the application.

### Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are leveraged to promote code reusability and maintainability. They enable the creation of more abstract and flexible components, contributing to a cleaner and more efficient codebase.

### Row (Inside USER_INPUT_SCREEN)

The inclusion of the Row layout inside the USER_INPUT_SCREEN demonstrates the effective use of composables to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
